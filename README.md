mouse_juggler.py
----------------
A simple "Mouse Juggler + Anti-Sleep" tool using pyautogui, ctypes, threading, and tkinter.

WHAT IT DOES
- Moves the mouse slightly at a regular interval to prevent the system from idling.
- Calls the Windows API SetThreadExecutionState to request the system and display stay awake.
- Provides a small Tkinter GUI with Start and Stop buttons.

IMPORTANT NOTES
- This script uses Windows-only API (ctypes.windll.kernel32.SetThreadExecutionState).
- Intended for legitimate use-cases (kiosk, presentation, testing). Do NOT use to bypass
  workplace/school monitoring policies or to deceive time-tracking systems.
- Requires Python and the `pyautogui` package installed:
    pip install pyautogui
